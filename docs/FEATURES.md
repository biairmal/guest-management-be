# Feature behaviour

How the app behaves, feature by feature — intent, invariants, endpoints, and lifecycle. This satisfies the "document how the app works" goal and is required for every feature (see [../AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md#documentation)). For the data model, see [DATABASE.md](DATABASE.md); for the roadmap of unbuilt features, see [DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md](DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md).

Each section follows the same template:

- **Intent** — what the feature is for.
- **Invariants** — rules that always hold (enforced in the service).
- **Endpoints** — HTTP surface (also in Swagger).
- **States & lifecycle** — how records are created, changed, and removed.

## events

Source: `internal/features/events`. Table: `event_categories` (see [DATABASE.md](DATABASE.md)).

### Intent

Manages **event categories** — the taxonomy events are classified under. Categories are either **app-defined** (available to every tenant) or **tenant-defined** (private to one tenant).

### Invariants

- `source` is one of `"app"` or `"tenant"`.
- When `source == "app"`, `tenant_id` **must be null** (a system category belongs to no tenant).
- When `source == "tenant"`, `tenant_id` **is required**.
- `name` is required and non-empty.
- On update (partial), only provided fields change; the same source/tenant rules re-apply to the resulting record.

> These are **business invariants** enforced in the service. Field-presence/format checks (`required`, `oneof`) should move to boundary validation on the input DTO (see [PATTERNS.md](PATTERNS.md#request-validation-boundary)); the cross-field source/tenant rule stays in the service.

### Endpoints

Base path `/api/v1/event-categories`:

| Method | Path | Purpose | Success | Notable errors |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/` | List (paginated, filtered, sorted) | 200 | 400 invalid query |
| `GET` | `/{id}` | Get one by UUID | 200 | 400 bad UUID · 404 not found |
| `POST` | `/` | Create | 201 | 400 invalid body · 409 conflict · 422 invalid entity |
| `PUT` | `/{id}` | Partial update | 200 | 400 · 404 not found |
| `DELETE` | `/{id}` | Soft delete | 204 | 400 · 404 not found |

**List query:** `?page=1&size=20&sort=name,ASC&sort=id,DESC&name=Gala&source=app`.
- `page` 1-based; `size` default 20, clamped to 100.
- `sort` repeatable, `field,DIR` — only fields in the allow-list (`id, source, tenant_id, name, created_at, updated_at`); unknown field → 400.
- Filters: `name`, `source`, `tenant_id` (exact match); unknown keys ignored.

### States & lifecycle

- **Create** — service generates the `id` (UUID); `created_at`/`updated_at` are stamped by the audit repository decorator.
- **Update** — partial; `updated_at` re-stamped by the decorator.
- **Delete** — **soft**: `deleted_at` is set; the row remains. All reads/lists automatically exclude soft-deleted rows (`deleted_at IS NULL`, injected by the decorator).
- **Errors** — repository sentinels are translated to `errorz` codes (`ErrNotFound`→404, `ErrAlreadyExists`→409, `ErrInvalidEntity`→422); unexpected errors become 500 and are logged with context.

## Template for new features

Copy this when adding a slice (and add a [feature-map](../AGENTS.md#feature-map) row):

```markdown
## <feature>

Source: `internal/features/<feature>`. Table(s): `<table>`.

### Intent
<one paragraph>

### Invariants
- <rule enforced in the service>

### Endpoints
| Method | Path | Purpose | Success | Notable errors |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

### States & lifecycle
<creation, transitions, soft-delete behaviour, error mapping>
```
